Swiftly was a collaborative IDE used to make games and interactive avatars for the [Whirled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whirled) online virtual world platform.

It consisted of a downloadable app or browser applet which performed ActionScript builds on the server, meaning the user did not need to install a local compiler. The compiled results were automatically inserted into the live virtual world environment. Limited collaboration was supported so that users could work on the same project simultaneously.
